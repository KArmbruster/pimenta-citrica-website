                    <h3>TESTIMONIALS</h3>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"Ana is the perfect person to teach this course. She's effortlessly friendly, infinitely knowledgeable, open, honest and vulnerable. She created a safe space to openly discuss a typically taboo subject, making it feel easy and fun. The session was an insightful mix of sex education, relationships, intimacy, tips, advice, and questions. Highly recommended."</p>

                        <p>"I am deeply touched by the shift of perspective, purely allowing myself to write without making it less erotic or my sensual mind play small. It's incredible – a self-limitation has vanished! I wonder now why it even existed before. I can't thank you enough for awakening this sense!"</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"I was nervous about attending. I had chosen this workshop to attend before coming to WHOLE, knowing it was something I had wanted to do for a while and have an experience like this, but I wasn't sure if I would be able to go or stay. But I am so moved and blown away by what was created. For a while after, when I'd talk about it, tears would come up for me. I think having a trans body like mine and having experienced abuse in the past, there was something so magical about all of us together being led in this way to touch our clits. Over the years, I've almost become a bit detached from my own touch, using vibrators and losing the magic of exploring myself. This was like coming home, but in a lake of other beautiful bodies having their own experience near you."</p>
