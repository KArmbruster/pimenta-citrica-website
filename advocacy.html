                <p>THE ADULT INDUSTRY FACES CONSTANT CENSORSHIP ONLINE, AND I'VE DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I WORK WITH POLICYMAKERS, INSTITUTIONS, AND COMMUNITIES TO DEFEND SEXUAL EXPRESSION, HOLD BIG TECH ACCOUNTABLE, AND PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF CREATORS AND MARGINALIZED VOICES. I LEAD CAMPAIGNS, COORDINATE RESEARCH, AND REPRESENT THE COALITION AT INTERNATIONAL EVENTS, ALL WITH THE GOAL OF SHAPING FAIRER POLICIES AND CREATING A SAFER, MORE INCLUSIVE DIGITAL SPACE FOR SEX-POSITIVE WORK. MY WORK IS ABOUT MAKING PLEASURE, INTIMACY, AND SEXUALITY VISIBLE, RESPECTED, AND PROTECTED.</p>

                <p>GET IN TOUCH IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO SPEAK AT YOUR EVENT, LEAD WORKSHOPS FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION, OR PROVIDE CONSULTANCY AT THE INTERSECTION OF INTIMACY, SEXUALITY, AND DIGITAL RIGHTS. I'M ALWAYS EXCITED TO COLLABORATE AND CREATE SOMETHING IMPACTFUL TOGETHER.</p>
