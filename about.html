                    <p>I WROTE MY FIRST EROTIC STORY AT TWELVE — AND I NEVER REALLY STOPPED. GROWING UP IN BRAZIL AS A QUEER WOMAN, I CARRIED A LOT OF SHAME AROUND MY SEXUALITY, SO I VOWED TO BECOME SOMEONE WHO COULD NORMALIZE DESIRE THE WAY I WISH SOMEONE HAD FOR ME. SINCE MOVING TO BERLIN IN 2016, I'VE CREATED SEX-POSITIVE CONTENT ACROSS MEDIUMS — FROM SCRIPTS AND AUDIO FOR BRANDS LIKE <strong>ERSTIES AND FEMTASY</strong>, TO VIDEO CONTENT, TO WORKSHOPS, LIVE EXPERIENCES, AND PUBLIC SPEAKING. I CO-CREATED <strong>I AM THE CLITORIS</strong>, A PROJECT ABOUT CLITORAL ANATOMY AND PLEASURE, AND I'VE RECENTLY EXPANDED INTO ADVOCACY, FIGHTING CENSORSHIP AND CHAMPIONING SEXUAL WELLNESS. MY WORK IS <strong>FEMINIST, QUEER-INCLUSIVE, AND CONSENT-CENTERED</strong> — <strong>BECAUSE PLEASURE IS PERSONAL, POLITICAL, AND TRANSFORMATIVE.</strong></p>
