                    <p>I wrote my first erotic story at twelve — and I never really stopped. Growing up in Brazil as a queer woman, I carried a lot of shame around my sexuality, so I vowed to become someone who could normalize desire the way I wish someone had for me. Since moving to Berlin in 2016, I've created sex-positive content across mediums — from scripts and audio for brands like <strong>Ersties and Femtasy</strong>, to video content, to workshops, live experiences, and public speaking. I co-created <strong>I Am The Clitoris</strong>, a project about clitoral anatomy and pleasure, and I've recently expanded into advocacy, fighting censorship and championing sexual wellness. My work is <strong>feminist, queer-inclusive, and consent-centered</strong> — <strong>because pleasure is personal, political, and transformative.</strong></p>
